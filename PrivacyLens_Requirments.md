    Then the extension should detect the new website
    And display the new URL in the popup
```

#### Privacy Data Collection
```gherkin
Feature: Privacy Data Collection
  Scenario: Detect tracking cookies
    Given the user visits a website with tracking cookies
    When the extension analyzes the page
    Then it should identify all tracking cookies
    And display them in the privacy data section
```

#### Privacy Rating
```gherkin
Feature: Privacy Rating
  Scenario: Calculate privacy score
    Given a website with moderate tracking
    When the extension analyzes privacy data
    Then it should calculate a privacy score
    And display the score with explanation
```
